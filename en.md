This is a screenshot of the web app. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you download *default_references.zip*. You can get this file by clicking the link marked by the red arrow.

Then decompress the zip file and you will get some illustrations like this.

There are 15 illustations with different colors in the default package. These illustrations are well-suited for the AI to learn and you can deal with nearly all sketches with these 15 images.

We will use this sketch as an example. This sketch is rich in detailed features and it is very suitable for AI colorization. We will describe some usages of our web app in the colorization procedure.

*The AI is also good at dealing with simple sketches without detailed features, check [here](https://github.com/lllyasviel/style2paints/blob/master/README.md) and find example 5.*

Now upload our sketch and reference. We use a reference illustration with blue hair and gray background. You can select any reference images with any color. You can improve the colorization quality by trying more references and finding the best one. There is no trick to find the best reference in a single try. The more, the better. We highly recommend you use the images in *default_references.zip* as these images are selected by the author and are well-suited for the AI to read.

You can click one of the two buttons to colorize your sketch.

These four toggles are important for AI painting. We now list the results below.

Here is the comparison.

Here is the detailed comparison.

In this example, I think the last is best, so let's continue with the last option.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19834515/31306723-7826e5e0-ab88-11e7-9f79-0c19cee53f91.png)

When we move our mouse to the reference image, the cursor will becomes a cross. In fact, the reference image is a color picker and you can select any color in it. Now we select the skin color on the face. A tiny square is left to the reference image and the selected color will be shown here. In the screenshot above, the skin color is selected and the selected color is shown on the tiny square.

After the skin color is selected, you can move your mouse to the sketch and add hints for the AI by clicking where there should be skin. You can click *colorize* to get new result and then add some additional hints and then click *colorize* and then add hints......But keep in mind that **small and pointed hints are fine and you do not need to fully fill color blocks**.

Now we add black hints to the tail.

After about 5 minutes, we get a good result. After this example, some may think that the last option is always the best and we do not need other options, but each option has its own drawbacks.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19834515/31306776-8169df80-ab89-11e7-906c-19b94eaf9c90.png)

Each of these options has advantages and disadvantages, and the second option is the best in the example above.

These toggles related to inputs are important.

The 3 screenshots above show how it improves the result by denoising.

The 4 screenshots above show how it does style transfer for illustations.

PS: You can add any color hints, but the AI will sometimes resist to the hints in some cases.

PSS: The secret of a good result is trying more reference images, and *default_references.zip* is recommended.
